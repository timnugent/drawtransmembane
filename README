Perl modules for drawing cartoons and schematics of transmembrane proteins

(c) Tim Nugent 2008

Some of these modules are now part of Bio-Graphics:

http://search.cpan.org/~lds/Bio-Graphics-2.36/lib/Bio/Graphics/DrawTransmembrane.pm

For sample images see here:

Installation
------------

Perl GD and SVG modules are required to use these modules. On Ubuntu, these packages can be installed:

libgd-gd2-perl
libgd-svg-perl

Otherwise use CPAN.

To run
------

Run each of the test scripts to generate output PNG/SVG files in the output directory. Scripts should be fairly self explanatory. To see full usage instructions, run e.g. 'perldoc lib/DrawHelicalWheel' on each of the .pm files in the lib directory.

Test_DrawHelicalWheel.pl
------------------------

Use this to draw a wheel representation of an alpha-helix. Useful for spotting amphipathic and pore forming helices. Can output to SVG 

Test_DrawTransmembrane.pl
-------------------------

Use this to draw and label cartoons of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins.

Test_DrawTransmembrane_Schematic.pl
-----------------------------------

Use this to draw a schematic showing multiple topologies, construct a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot and to generate a consensus.
